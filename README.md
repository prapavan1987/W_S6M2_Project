# React Components Insta Clone

## Component Composition Module Project

## Introduction

For this project, you'll build a simple Instagram clone using React. There is a file provided `frontend/data/dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. 
Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post. Your React application will receive this faux post data and render each as a separate 
Instagram post.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

- [ ]  Clone the repository to your machine using your terminal
- [ ]  CD into the project base directory `cd React-Components-Insta-Clone`
- [ ]  Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ]  Start up the app using `npm run dev`
- [ ]  Push commits: git push origin `main`

### Task 2: MVP

This app can be broken down into two main sections that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar and the Posts. 

A Search Bar will be rendered at the top of the page, and a Posts component will render an individual Post for every object inside the `dummy-data.js` array. 
You'll need to set up state to keep track of the posts. You will implement a callback to increase the "likes count" on posts and hand it several levels down 
into a nested component through props.

Look through the code before you start. There are a lot of files. Not all of them need code added to them. Start in the App.js file and read the instructions
 there.
